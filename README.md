    <p> Atoms and molecules are too small to count. To solve this problem their numbers are expressed in terms of Avogadro‚Äôs number (NA = 6.023 √ó 1023). Mole is the number equal to Avogadro‚Äôs number just like a dozen is equal to 12, a century means 100, a score means = 20.

A mole (symbol mol) is defined as the amount of substance that contains as many atoms, molecules, ions electrons or any other elementary entities as there are carbon atoms in exactly 12 gm of 12 C . The number of atoms in 12 gm of 12 C is called Avogadro‚Äôs number (NA).

NA = 6.023 x 1023

One atomic mass unit (amu) = 1/NA = 1/6.023 x 1023gm = 1.66 x 10-24 gm = 1.66 x 10-27 kg

Mole Concept

The number of moles of a substance can be calculated by various means depending on data available, as follows.

Number of moles of moleculesMole Concept
Number of moles of atomsMole Concept
Number of moles of gasesMole Concept (Standard molar volume at STP = 22.4 lit)
Number of moles of particles e.g. atoms, molecules ions etcMole Concept
Mole ConceptMole Concept
for a compound Ax By, y moles of A = x moles of B
Mole fraction = fraction of the substance in the mixture expressed in terms of mol is called its mol fraction (X)
E.g. for a mixture of substance A & B
